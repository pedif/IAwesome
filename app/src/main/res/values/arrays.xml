        <item>Someone is looking hot today!</item>
        <item>You are my one and only. My beginning and the end. The sun in my days and the moon in my nights.</item>
        <item>I wanted to tell you that I love you no matter what.</item>
        <item>Hang in there you got this.</item>
        <item>Confidence is the key and you got a butt load of it.</item>
        <item>The weather was 4 degrees warmer today. Did you wear that shirt again?</item>
        <item>Oh my god that shirt? Again?! Come one, we talked about this. You in that shirt is one the reasons global
            warming is a thing now.
        </item>
        <item>The word luxury is defined by my man right here.</item>
        <item>You have just created a new definition for the word handsome with that outfit.</item>
        <item>That tie, those shoes, that watch; some women are going to have a hard time sleeping tonight.</item>
        <item>Take care of that body because that form is worth a million bucks maybe more.</item>
        <item>You can make it and you will.</item>
        <item>Do you hit the gym or do you look like that naturally because damn!</item>
        <item>You are going to get it today.</item>
        <item>Success is your middle name.</item>
        <item>Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.</item>
        <item>Do not wait; the time will never be \'just right.\' Start where you stand, and work with whatever
            tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
        </item>
        <item>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</item>
        <item>Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in
            your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.</item>
        <item>Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.</item>
        <item>Good, better, best. Never let it rest. \'Til your good is better and your better is best.</item>
        <item>Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.</item>
        <item>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.</item>
        <item>Start by doing what\'s necessary; then do what\'s possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.</item>
        <item>I can\'t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.</item>
